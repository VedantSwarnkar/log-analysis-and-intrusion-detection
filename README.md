# log-analysis-and-intrusion-detection
project focused on monitoring system logs to detect intrusion attempts and mapping them to known vulnerabilities using the NIST NVD API.

1️⃣ Objective The goal of this project is to analyze system logs to detect intrusion attempts and map them to known vulnerabilities using NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This helps in identifying and mitigating cyber threats based on log data.

2️⃣ Why Is This Important? System logs contain critical security data: Logs store login attempts, network access records, and system changes that can help detect security breaches. Attackers leave traces in logs: Failed login attempts, unauthorized access, and unusual patterns indicate potential intrusions. Mapping logs to vulnerabilities (CVE database) allows security teams to prioritize responses based on known threats.

THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YET TO BE COMMITED
